CHART DEBUGGING - FOLLOW THESE STEPS
===============================================================================

The dashboard is now running with debug mode enabled!

STEP 1: REFRESH YOUR BROWSER
-----------------------------
Press Ctrl+F5 (hard refresh) to reload with the new fixes

STEP 2: CHECK FOR ALERT POPUP
------------------------------
If charts don't load, you'll see a popup alert with the error message.
Click OK and proceed to Step 3.

STEP 3: OPEN BROWSER CONSOLE  
-----------------------------
Press F12 to open Developer Tools
Click the "Console" tab
Look for messages that say:

  ✓ "Loading dashboard data..."
  ✓ "Stats data: {object}"
  ✓ "Plotly.js loaded successfully"
  ✓ "Creating timeline chart..."
  ✓ "All charts created successfully!"

STEP 4: CHECK FOR ERRORS
-------------------------
If you see RED error messages in console, take note of them:

Common errors and what they mean:
- "Plotly is not defined" = CDN not loading (check internet)
- "Cannot read property 'hours' of undefined" = Data structure issue
- "statsData is null" = Data not passed from Flask

STEP 5: TEST PAGES
------------------
Try these pages to narrow down the issue:

1. Test page: http://127.0.0.1:5000/test-charts
   - Should show 3 colorful charts
   - If this works = Plotly is fine, data issue
   - If this fails = Plotly not loading

2. Overview: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   - Check console for errors
   - Note which chart fails

3. Outliers: http://127.0.0.1:5000/outliers
   - Check console for errors

WHAT TO SHARE WITH ME:
----------------------
If charts still don't work, share:

1. Screenshot of browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Any popup alert messages
3. Which browser you're using
4. Does the test page work? (http://127.0.0.1:5000/test-charts)

QUICK FIXES TO TRY:
-------------------
□ Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
□ Try different browser (Chrome/Firefox)
□ Check internet connection
□ Clear browser cache
□ Restart dashboard server
